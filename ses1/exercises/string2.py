# Additional basic string exercises

# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3,
# add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case
# add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.
def verbing(s):
  # first we check if the string is at least length of 3
  if len(s) >= 3:
    # check if it ends with ing
    if s.endswith('ing'):
      # we take the original string, and add ly to its end
      return s + 'ly'
    else:
      # we take the original string, and add ing to its end
      return s + 'ing'
  return s

       


# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first appearance of the
# substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring
# with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
# This dinner is good!
def not_bad(s):
 # first we check if not and bad exists in string
 if 'not' in s and 'bad' in s:
   # we find the index of not and bad
   not_index = s.index('not')
   bad_index = s.index('bad') + len('bad')
   if not_index < bad_index:
    not_bad_substring = s[not_index:bad_index]
    s = s.replace(not_bad_substring, 'good')
 return s      


  


# F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
# If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
#  a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back

def front_back(a, b):
  # First we check if the length of string a is odd

  # we get the front of string a, remember to get the extra letter
  
  # we get the back of string a, remember to get the extra letter

  # else  
  # If the length of the string is even
  # we get the front of string a, we dont need the extra letter, since the length is even
  # we get the back of string a, we dont need the extra letter, since the length is even
  # we check if the length of string b is odd 
 # we get the front of string b, remember to get the extra letter
 # we get the back of string b, remember to get the extra letter
  #else
